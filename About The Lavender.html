<h1 style="color:lightblue">About the Lavender</h1>
<h2 style="color:chartreuse">The Product</h2>
<p style="colr:ghostwhite">We planted the current 600 plants in the summer of 2011.  The climate in the Grand Junction area proved to be what the lavender plants needed to thrive.  The fertile ground that had once been and alfalfa field provided the minerals that significantly promoted the growth of the world class lavender plants.   The field currently yields more than a ton of lavender blossoms each year and they are distilled into premium essential oil and hydrosol.</p>
<h2 style="color:chartreuse">The Awards</h2>
<p style="color:ghostwhite">The oil produced by Larry and Celia plants received the <q style="color:silver">SILVER AWARD</q> from the New Zealand Lavender Association's International Competition. </p>
