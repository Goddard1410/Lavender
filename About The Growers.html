<h2 style="color:chartreuse">Them and there Lavender</h2>
<p style="color:ghostwhite">Celia and Larry Eklund are lavender growers who retired as public school educators.  They are motivated to bring beauty and comfort to the lives of other people.  Celia is a cancer survivor and that fact was an integral part in Larry's desire to produce a crop that would bring beauty and peace into their lives.  As the lavender grew from tiny plants to large lush bushes, Larry's dream was fulfilled.  On summer days they can stroll in a field of  waist high lavender, smell the incredible fragrance of the gorgeous blossoms, and inhale the peace that the lavender brings to them.  Now their drive is focused on bringing that beauty and calm to others thru bouquets of dried lavender flowers, essential lavender oil, and lavender hydrosol.
